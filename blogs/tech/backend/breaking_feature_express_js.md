## Introduction

I recently faced a challenge while upgrading my Express.js application from version 4.x to 5.x. The upgrade introduced some changes in how regular expressions (RegEx) are handled, which caused issues in my code. In this blog post, I will share the problem I encountered and how I resolved it.

---

## The Problem

When I upgraded to Express.js v5.x, I noticed that some of my routes were not working as expected. Specifically, the RegEx patterns I had used in my route definitions were no longer matching correctly. This was due to changes in how Express.js v5.x handles RegEx patterns compared to v4.x.

## The Error

```text

```

## The Solution

To resolve this issue, I had to update my RegEx patterns to be compatible with the new version of Express.js. The key change was to ensure that all named parameters in my RegEx patterns were properly defined.

I went through my route definitions and made sure that each named parameter was correctly specified. For example, if I had a route like this:

```javascript
app.get("/*", (req, res) => {
  // Handler code
});
```

I realized that the wildcard `*` was not being treated as a named parameter in the new version. Instead, I needed to explicitly define it as a named parameter.

I updated it to explicitly define the named parameter:

```javascript
app.get("{*splate}", (req, res) => {
  // Handler code
});
```

## Conclusion

By carefully reviewing and updating my RegEx patterns, I was able to resolve the issues caused by the upgrade to Express.js v5.x. This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly testing and validating route definitions when upgrading dependencies in a project.

## Learning Points

- Always check the migration documentation when upgrading major versions of libraries.
- Regular expressions can change in behavior between versions, so be prepared to update them.
- Thoroughly test your application after making upgrades to catch any issues early.
- Use named parameters in RegEx patterns to ensure compatibility with future versions of Express.js.
- Keep an eye on the GitHub issues page for the library you are using, as others may have encountered similar problems and found solutions.
- Consider using tools like `path-to-regexp` to help manage and validate your route definitions.
- Stay updated with the latest changes in the libraries you use, as they may introduce breaking changes that require adjustments in your code.
- Utilize community resources, such as forums and documentation, to find solutions to common issues encountered during upgrades.
- Maintain a backup of your code before performing major upgrades, so you can easily revert if necessary.
- Document any changes made during the upgrade process to help future developers understand the modifications and their purpose.
